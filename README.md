This project implements an AI-driven plagiarism detection system that combines traditional NLP similarity techniques with a Siamese LSTM deep learning model to detect both exact and semantic plagiarism between text documents.

🎯 Key Highlights

Performed end-to-end text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, lemmatization)

Extracted features using TF-IDF

Computed similarity using cosine similarity and fuzzy matching

Built a Siamese LSTM network to capture semantic similarity between text pairs

Improved detection of paraphrased and contextually similar content

🛠️ Tech Stack

Python

Pandas, NumPy

NLTK / spaCy

Scikit-learn (TF-IDF, Cosine Similarity)

TensorFlow / Keras (Siamese LSTM)

Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab

📊 Output

Accurate similarity scores for text pairs

Detection of exact, partial, and semantic plagiarism

Robust comparison for real-world plagiarism scenarios

🔮 Enhancements

BERT-based semantic similarity

Streamlit web deployment

Multi-document plagiarism comparison
